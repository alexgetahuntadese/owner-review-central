        correct: '3.7 × 10¹⁰ Bq',
        explanation: 'Activity = λN = (ln2/t₁/₂) × (mass/atomic mass) × NA. This calculation gives approximately 3.7×10¹⁰ Bq (1 Curie).',

        question: 'What is the reproduction factor (k) for a critical nuclear reactor?',
        options: ['k < 1', 'k = 1', 'k > 1', 'k = 0'],
        correct: 'k = 1',
        explanation: 'For a critical reactor, k = 1, meaning each fission produces exactly one subsequent fission.',
